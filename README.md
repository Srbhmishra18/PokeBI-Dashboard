## Motivation
My journey with Pokémon started with Pokémon Go, which inspired me to combine my professional skillset with a personal interest. By integrating elements from the world of Pokémon into a Power BI dashboard, I aimed to demonstrate how data visualization can transform abstract numbers into compelling stories and interactive experiences.
